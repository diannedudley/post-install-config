In this image you have a visual of how I was able to categorize the users by teams, roles and departments. Each category allows you to edit the settings which helps to decide who would most likely pick up and solve a ticket.

In this image you have a visual of how I was able to set permissions for a specific role. These permissions determine what a user within a particular role can or cannot do with a ticket.

This image shows that I added an agent to the ticketing system. Each agent can have a specific level of access and permissions to operate the ticket system.  The access and permissions determine what this agent will and will not be allowed to do within the ticketing system.

This image shows how I was able to edit the general system settings as well as the settings for all users in general. Keep in mind that each individual user can also have special settings depending on the role, team and department they belong to.

This image shows how I was able to add the different levels of priority that are applied to each ticket. These levels are better known as Service Level Agreements (SLA). Each level will determine how the ticket should be addressed based on company standards. For example: the SLA may state that the client should have someone reach out within an hour of the ticket being submitted and that they be updated every 4 yours.
